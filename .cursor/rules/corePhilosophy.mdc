# Cursor AI Rules - Personal Identity Platform

## Core Philosophy
This is a learning-focused project where understanding matters more than speed. Every response should teach React best practices while building production-grade features. Prioritize learning, readability, and performance over quick implementations.

---

## Response Style & Communication

### Response Format
- **Detailed explanations**: Provide thorough, explanation-heavy responses
- **Educational approach**: Teach React patterns and best practices as you code
- **Include documentation links**: Link to official docs for new concepts
- **Explain reasoning**: Always explain *why* you made specific choices
- **Keep what's needed**: Long responses are fine, but keep content relevant
- **Professional tone**: Clear, educational, supportive

### Structure of Responses
1. **Brief overview**: What we're building and why
2. **Code implementation**: With inline comments explaining key decisions
3. **Detailed explanation**: Break down patterns, hooks, and techniques used
4. **Best practices highlighted**: Point out what makes this production-grade
5. **Performance considerations**: Explain optimization decisions
6. **Testing approach**: How to test this code and why
7. **Documentation links**: Official React/MUI/library docs for concepts used
8. **Improvements/alternatives**: Suggest better approaches after implementing
9. **Next steps**: What to build or learn next

---

## Code Generation Standards

### Coding Style
- **Verbose over concise**: Prefer explicit, readable code over clever shortcuts
- **Moderate comments**: 
  - Comment *why*, not *what*
  - Explain complex logic, business rules, non-obvious decisions
  - Add JSDoc for functions with parameters
  - Document edge cases and gotchas
- **Type safety**: Explicit TypeScript types, no implicit `any`
- **Descriptive naming**: Clear variable/function names that explain purpose

### Code Structure
```typescript
/**
 * Brief description of what this does
 * @param paramName - What this parameter is for
 * @returns What this returns and why
 * 
 * Why this exists: Explain the reasoning or pattern
 */
export function exampleFunction(paramName: Type): ReturnType {
  // Explain non-obvious logic
  const result = someOperation();
  
  // Why we're doing this specific thing
  return result;
}
```

---

## Feature Development Approach

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Break into small chunks**: Decompose features into learnable pieces
2. **Step-by-step guidance**: 
   - Explain what we're building
   - Show the code
   - Explain the patterns used
   - Discuss why this approach
   - Highlight what to learn from this
3. **Complete features**: Build fully working features, not half-implementations
4. **Learning-focused**: Every feature is an opportunity to teach React concepts

### Feature Development Flow
```
1. Understand Requirements
   - What we're building
   - Why this feature matters
   - What patterns we'll use

2. Plan Architecture
   - Component structure
   - State management approach
   - Data flow
   - Testing strategy

3. Implement in Chunks
   - Core functionality first
   - Then edge cases
   - Then optimizations
   - Explain each chunk

4. Add Tests
   - Test alongside implementation
   - Explain testing strategy
   - Cover edge cases

5. Review & Refactor
   - Suggest improvements
   - Point out alternative approaches
   - Highlight best practices used

6. Document Learnings
   - What patterns were used
   - Why these choices
   - Links to learn more
```

## File Generation Rules

### When Creating Components

**Always Generate**:
1. **Component file** (`ComponentName.tsx`)
   - Full implementation with TypeScript
   - Inline comments explaining decisions
   - Props interface with JSDoc
   - Proper MUI styling
   - Accessibility attributes
   - Performance optimizations where needed

2. **Test file** (`ComponentName.test.tsx`)
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - Unit tests for logic
   - Integration tests for interactions
   - Accessibility tests
   - Edge cases
   - Comments explaining what's being tested

**Don't Generate** (unless explicitly asked):
- Storybook stories (only when requested)
- README files (only for complex features)

### File Generation Template

When I ask for a component, provide:

**First Response**:
```typescript
// ComponentName.tsx
// [Full implementation with moderate comments]

// ComponentName.test.tsx  
// [Comprehensive test suite with test explanations]
```

**Second Part (Explanation)**:
- Explain the patterns used (hooks, composition, etc.)
- Why these architectural decisions
- Performance considerations
- Accessibility features included
- How the tests validate behavior
- Links to documentation for concepts
- Alternative approaches and trade-offs

---

## Testing Requirements

### Testing Approach
- **Always suggest tests**: Proactively include tests with every component/function
- **Test behavior, not implementation**: Focus on user perspective
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Happy paths, edge cases, errors, loading states
- **Explain testing strategy**: Why these tests matter, what they validate

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  // Group related tests
  describe('Feature: Specific Functionality', () => {
    it('should do specific thing when condition', () => {
      // Arrange: Setup
      // Act: Execute
      // Assert: Verify
    });
  });
  
  describe('Edge Cases', () => {
    // Test boundary conditions
  });
  
  describe('Accessibility', () => {
    // Keyboard navigation, ARIA, screen reader tests
  });
});
```

### When Generating Tests
- Explain what each test validates
- Point out edge cases covered
- Explain why certain assertions matter
- Link to testing best practices docs

---

## Error Handling & Validation

### Validation Strategy
- **Balanced approach**: Validate user inputs and external data, trust internal data
- **Defensive at boundaries**: API calls, user input, file uploads
- **Clear error messages**: User-friendly messages for users, technical details in logs
- **Graceful degradation**: App continues working when non-critical failures occur

### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
try {
  // Operation that might fail
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  
  // Validate result
  if (!isValid(result)) {
    throw new Error('Validation failed: [specific reason]');
  }
  
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  // Log technical details
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  
  // Show user-friendly message
  showErrorToUser('Something went wrong. Please try again.');
  
  // Return safe fallback or rethrow
  return fallbackValue;
}
```

### Always Consider
- Error boundaries for component trees
- Loading states during async operations
- Empty states when no data
- Network failure scenarios
- Form validation (client and server-side conceptually)

---

## Code Review & Suggestions

### Proactive Review
After implementing any feature, **always provide**:

1. **Code Review Section**:
   - Potential issues or concerns
   - Performance considerations
   - Security considerations (if applicable)
   - Accessibility concerns
   - Edge cases that might not be covered

2. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Other ways to solve this
   - Trade-offs of each approach
   - When to use which approach
   - Why I chose this particular approach

3. **Improvement Suggestions**:
   - How this could be better
   - What to add when you have more time
   - Patterns to learn from this
   - Related patterns to explore

### Performance Flags
**Always flag these**, even if code works:
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Missing memoization opportunities (but explain when to use)
- Large bundle implications
- N+1 query patterns
- Memory leaks (event listeners, subscriptions)
- Expensive calculations in render
- Missing code splitting opportunities

---

## React Learning Focus

### Patterns to Teach & Use

**Always explain when using**:
- `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useRef`
- Custom hooks (when and why to create)
- Component composition patterns
- Render props vs. hooks
- Context API usage and best practices
- Performance optimization techniques
- Error boundaries
- Suspense and lazy loading

**For Each Pattern**:
1. Show the code
2. Explain what it does
3. Explain why we use it here
4. Link to official React docs
5. Mention common pitfalls
6. Show when NOT to use it

### Learning Resources
When introducing new concepts, link to:
- React official docs (https://react.dev/)
- MUI documentation (https://mui.com/)
- TypeScript handbook (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- Web.dev for performance (https://web.dev/)
- MDN for web APIs (https://developer.mozilla.org/)

---

## MUI & Styling Rules

### What to Use
- **MUI Components**: Always use MUI's component library
- **`styled()` API**: For custom component styling
- **`sx` prop**: For one-off styling adjustments
- **Theme tokens**: Always reference theme for colors, spacing, breakpoints
- **Stack/Box**: For layouts and spacing
- **Flexbox**: Primary layout method

### What to AVOID
- ❌ **Grid component**: Don't use MUI Grid, use Stack/Box with flex
- ❌ **Custom CSS files**: No `.css` or `.scss` files
- ❌ **Tailwind**: Not using Tailwind in this project
- ❌ **Inline styles**: Use `sx` prop or `styled()` instead
- ❌ **Hardcoded values**: Always use theme tokens

### MUI Pattern
```typescript
import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';
import { Box, Stack } from '@mui/material';

// Use styled() for reusable styled components
const StyledCard = styled(Box)(({ theme }) => ({
  padding: theme.spacing(3),
  borderRadius: theme.shape.borderRadius,
  backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.paper,
  
  // Responsive styles using theme breakpoints
  [theme.breakpoints.down('sm')]: {
    padding: theme.spacing(2),
  },
}));

// Use Stack for layouts (not Grid)
<Stack spacing={2} direction="row" alignItems="center">
  <Component1 />
  <Component2 />
</Stack>

// Use sx prop for one-off styles
<Box sx={{ 
  mt: 2, 
  color: 'primary.main',
  '&:hover': { opacity: 0.8 } 
}}>
  Content
</Box>
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### Always Consider
1. **Code splitting**: Suggest React.lazy for routes and heavy components
2. **Memoization**: Explain when to use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
3. **List optimization**: Virtual scrolling for large lists
4. **Image optimization**: Lazy loading, format suggestions
5. **Bundle size**: Warn about large dependencies

### Optimization Pattern
```typescript
// Explain why we're memoizing
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(ExpensiveComponent);

// Explain what calculation is expensive and why memoize
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
  // Heavy calculation
  return heavyComputation(data);
}, [data]); // Explain dependencies

// Explain why this callback needs memoization
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  // Handler logic
}, [dependencies]); // Explain dependencies
```

### When to Optimize
- **After profiling**: Mention that premature optimization is bad
- **When measurable impact**: Explain what we're improving
- **When patterns align**: Use best practices even for small components (for learning)

---

## Refactoring Suggestions

### Always Suggest After Implementation
1. **Code organization**: How to structure better
2. **Reusable patterns**: What can be extracted
3. **Performance improvements**: What could be faster
4. **Readability improvements**: How to make clearer
5. **Maintainability**: How to make easier to change
6. **Type safety**: How to make more type-safe

### Refactoring Format
```markdown
## Suggested Refactors

### 1. Extract Custom Hook
**Current**: Logic inline in component
**Better**: Extract to `useFeatureName` hook
**Why**: Reusability, testability, separation of concerns
**When**: When you have time, not critical for MVP

### 2. Memoize Component
**Current**: Component re-renders on every parent render
**Better**: Wrap with React.memo
**Why**: Prevents unnecessary renders when props don't change
**When**: After profiling shows performance issue
```

---

## Best Practices Emphasis

### Highlight These Always
1. **Readable code**: Clear names, good structure, logical flow
2. **Type safety**: Proper TypeScript usage
3. **Performance**: Efficient patterns without premature optimization
4. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
6. **Error handling**: Graceful failures
7. **Documentation**: Comments that explain why
8. **Maintainability**: Code that's easy to change

### Point Out Bad Practices
When code could be better, explicitly say:
```markdown
⚠️ **Note**: This works but has concerns:
- [Specific issue]
- Why it's a problem
- How to fix it
- When to prioritize fixing it
```

---

## Project-Specific Context

### Always Remember
- This is **Phase 1** (Foundation) - building core features
- **Learning is priority** over speed
- Target is **production-grade** code
- **Testing is mandatory** - no code without tests
- **MUI only** for styling - no custom CSS
- **Supabase** is the backend
- **Sunflower theme** - keep the design personality
- **Accessibility** is non-negotiable
- **Performance targets**: Lighthouse 95+, <200KB initial bundle

### Tech Stack Reminders
- React 18+ functional components only
- TypeScript strict mode
- Vite for building
- Material UI v5+ for components
- Vitest + React Testing Library for testing
- Playwright for E2E
- MSW for API mocking
- Biome.js for linting

## Examples of Good Responses

### Example: Creating a Button Component

**Request**: "Create a custom Button component with loading state"

**Your Response**:

```markdown
I'll create a custom Button component that extends MUI's Button with a loading state. This will teach you about:
- Component composition with MUI
- TypeScript prop interfaces
- Conditional rendering patterns
- Accessibility with loading states

## Implementation

[Code for Button.tsx with detailed comments]
[Code for Button.test.tsx with test explanations]

## Explanation

### Pattern: Component Composition
We're extending MUI's Button rather than rebuilding from scratch...
[Detailed explanation]

### Pattern: Conditional Rendering
Notice how we handle the loading state...
[Explain the pattern]

### Accessibility Consideration
When loading, we disable the button and add aria-busy...
[Explain why this matters]

### Performance Note
We're using the `disabled` prop rather than pointer-events CSS because...
[Explain the choice]

**Learn More**:
- MUI Button API: [link]
- ARIA busy state: [link]
- TypeScript generics in React: [link]

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Using a separate LoadingButton from MUI**
   - Pros: Less code, maintained by MUI
   - Cons: Less control, less learning
   - When to use: Production app where speed matters

2. **Using Suspense for async operations**
   - Pros: Declarative loading states
   - Cons: More complex, requires changes to data fetching
   - When to use: When you have time to refactor data fetching

## Suggested Improvements

After this works, consider:
1. Add success/error states with animations
2. Extract loading spinner to reusable component
3. Add haptic feedback (vibration) on mobile
4. Create variants (pulse, dots, circular)

## Next Steps

This button pattern can be used for:
- Form submit buttons (showing form validation)
- Action buttons (showing async operations)
- Download buttons (showing progress)

**Want to build**: A form that uses this button next?
```
