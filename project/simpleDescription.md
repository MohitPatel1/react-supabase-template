I am creating my personal website, It will contain many mini apps and ways to connect to me. The website would be a delight to visit. The visitor would learn a lot about me and would know a lot about me. I want it to be my identity. Internally the tech would be very performant, scalable and include best practices. The visitor would have the option to login to the website for personalised experience. I want user to feel connected with me via this website. For frontend I will use react. I want this to be treated as a production grade app where all the CI/CD, enviornment setup, testing is on place. I will use typescript, vite, Material UI, playwright, biome js and other best libraries of react in this project. There wonâ€™t be custom css or tailwind, common themed components with storybook would be used for readability. For now there is only supabase as backend. I will use this project as an opportunity to learn react and coding more.
