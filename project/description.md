Personal Identity Platform - Comprehensive Project Description
Project Overview
A production-grade personal website serving as a digital identity platform that creates meaningful connections between the creator (Mohit Patel) and visitors. The platform combines portfolio showcase, interactive mini-applications, and personalization features to deliver a delightful, performant, and memorable experience.
Core Purpose & Vision
This website transcends traditional portfolio sites by becoming an interactive, living representation of the creator's professional identity. Visitors will discover, learn, and engage through immersive experiences while benefiting from cutting-edge performance optimizations and scalable architecture. The project doubles as a practical learning laboratory for mastering advanced React patterns and modern web development practices.

CI/CD Pipeline
Version Control: Git with conventional commits, feature branch workflow
Automated Testing: Run on every PR - unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
Code Quality Gates: Biome.js checks, TypeScript compilation, test coverage thresholds (>80%)
Build Pipeline: Automated builds on merge to main branch
Deployment: Automatic deployment to staging on merge, manual promotion to production
Rollback Strategy: Easy rollback mechanism for failed deployments
Monitoring: Error tracking with Sentry or similar, performance monitoring
Testing Strategy
Unit Tests: Component logic, utility functions, custom hooks (Vitest)
Integration Tests: Component interactions, API integrations (React Testing Library)
E2E Tests: Critical user flows, authentication, form submissions (Playwright)
Visual Regression: Screenshot comparison for UI consistency
Performance Tests: Lighthouse CI integration, bundle size monitoring
Test Coverage: Maintain >80% coverage for critical paths
Code Organization
Feature-Based Structure: Group by feature rather than file type
Shared Components: Reusable component library with Storybook documentation
Custom Hooks: Extract reusable logic into well-tested hooks
